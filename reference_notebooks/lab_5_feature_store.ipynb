    "## Task 2.1: Feature Store options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to store features in Amazon SageMaker:\n",
    "1. Using Amazon SageMaker Feature Store as an Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler destination after preprocessing steps have been completed and features have been added.\n",
    "2. Exporting a notebook from SageMaker Data Wrangler that runs through feature definition, feature group creation, and ingestion of data into SageMaker Feature Store.\n",
    "3. Using the SageMaker Python SDK in a custom notebook that runs through feature definition, feature group creation, and ingestion of data into SageMaker Feature Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these three options are outlined in following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using SageMaker Feature Store as a SageMaker Data Wrangler destination\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add SageMaker Feature Store as a destination in Amazon SageMaker Studio using the **Add destination** option. When you are finished with preprocessing steps in SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can choose **Add destination** in your flow. SageMaker Studio guides you through feature group creation and how to complete the necessary steps to ingest your preprocessed data into SageMaker Feature Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to [Easily Create and Store Features in Amazon SageMaker Without Code](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/easily-create-and-store-features-in-amazon-sagemaker-without-code/#save_features_to_feature_store) for more information about adding SageMaker Feature Store as a destination.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exporting a notebook from SageMaker Data Wrangler\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create feature groups using the **Export to** option in SageMaker Studio. When using the **Export to** option, you can create a notebook that includes all the commands necessary to create a feature group.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few customizations, you can run through the notebook to do the following:\n",
    "- Create a feature definition based on your dataset.\n",
    "- Create a feature group using the feature definition.\n",
    "- Store the feature group in SageMaker Feature Store.\n",
    "- Set up the inputs and outputs of a processing job.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is similar to the exported notebook. This lab focuses on the first part of the exported notebook. It shows how to ingest data into the feature group and extract records from an online store and an offline store.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, you create a feature group and extract records from an online store and an offline store. You learn how SageMaker Feature Store works using a custom notebook. You set up the environment in Task 2. Then you complete the following tasks:\n",

    "Congratulations! You have used SageMaker Feature Store to make feature definitions for a feature group in SageMaker Studio and with the SageMaker Python SDK. With your newly created feature group, you are ready to train and tune your model using SageMaker Experiments in the next lab. Even later in the course, SageMaker Feature Store is useful for supplementing data for inference requests because of the low-latency GetRecord functionality using the online store. You continue working with this customer income dataset in the next lab.\n",
